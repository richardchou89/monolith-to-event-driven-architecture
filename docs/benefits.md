Some of the benefits of using queues in your architecture:

1. Process tasks asynchronously: offload time-consuming operations, like sending emails, processing images, and generating embeddings.
2. Communication between services: decouple your services by passing messages through a central queue.
3. Load Balancing: Distribute tasks evenly across multiple workers.
